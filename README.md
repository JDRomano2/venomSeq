### What is this?
Venoms provide an incredible opportunity for drug discovery. Over the course of human history, thousands of therapeutic uses for venoms have been discovered, and recent decades have seen a number of these be turned into FDA-approved drugs. However, most of these effects were discovered accidentally, and the rest were only found as the result of decades of systematic research.

`VenomSeq` is a tool that aims to change this, providing a new way to generate high-thoughput sequencing data for perturbational differential expression analysis of venoms applied to human cell lines in a scalable, inexpensive manner.

We are preparing a preprint describing `VenomSeq` in-depth, and will post a link here as soon as one is available.

This python package contains the algorithms and data structures needed for analyzing the data generated by `VenomSeq`.
